# EquinoxCrow

Once, he was just a man—Kyle Ault, trying to love, to live, to protect.  
The world forced him into shadows. Crow arose: a predator, a sovereign of carnage and calamity, reveling in lust, gluttony, and unrelenting wrath.  
Even the gods whisper his name; Anubis himself shudders, muttering, "I have not faced such darkness."  
This repository is his dominion: his skills, his history, his creations, and the monster within.  
Enter if you dare. Witness what once merely sought to remain a man… before they killed him and left a monster wearing his corpse.
